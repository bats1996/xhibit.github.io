            <h1>History of Xhibit</h1>

            <p>Xhibit was originally founded in 1997 by Chelsea College graduates Kit Hammonds and Angela Robinson. As this exhibition open call was created by students for students it has stayed within Arts SU as a crucial legacy project. For many students Xhibit functions to provide their first exhibition experience outside of their college environment. 

                <p>"I was the Vice-President elected for Chelsea College of Art. As I was responsible for the Events, I was keen to do more than just bar and ball kind of activities. Xhibit was started partly in response to the fact there wasn’t much cross-college, or even cross-site, contacts and it seemed sensible to start with the common ground between art and design students, the opportunity to show the work alongside one another irrespective of disciplines, specialisms or stage. It was open to any student." 
                
                - Kit Hammonds, co-founder of Xhibit, freelance Curator and tutor on Curating Contemporary Art at RCA.</p>
                
                <p>Since its original inception, Xhibit has grown to become the longest running open-call exhibition opportunity for students at UAL. It has grown to include a substantial professional development strand, media partnerships and bursary opportunities.</p>
