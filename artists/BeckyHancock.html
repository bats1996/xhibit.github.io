    <h2>Becky Hancock</h2>
    <h3>BA Fine Art Drawing<br>Camberwell College of Arts</h3>
    <p>Becky Hancock (b. 1998, UK) is an Artist and Curator based in East Sussex. Through drawing, sculpture and film the artist deconstructs and distorts the domestic. Whether this is through familiar sounds, actions or scenes that surround the domestic routine it is accumulated into a matter of on-going reflection. A hyper focused view of their surroundings and belongings demonstrates objects conversing together but isolated in momentary observations of space. Through a minimal style, the familiar becomes a permanent focus and subject, arising themes of solipsism, anticipation and repetition. 
    <br>Becky is the founder of Middleground, an artist-led platform hosting digital and physical exhibitions, she is interested in exhibiting artists in alternative spaces out of the traditional gallery environment. Middleground is formed of a curatorial collective of artists who are dedicated in creating an accessible and inclusive platform providing opportunities for all emerging talent.
