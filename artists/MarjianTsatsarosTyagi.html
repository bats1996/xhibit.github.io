    <h2>Marjian Tsatsaros Tyagi</h2>
    <h3>BA Fine Art Photography<br>Camberwell College of Arts</h3>
    <p>Marjian Tsatsaros Tyagi is a practising contemporary artist and curator with a mixed Indian, Canadian, Greek, Scottish background born and raised in London.  
        <br>Throughout her curation she explores new mediums and practises aiming to open the door to new artists, movements and the underrepresented voices of the art world.  
        <br>The intention is to create new worlds for people to explore via art using curation as an empowering channel to do this, both for artist and the public. Her curatorial approach is as an artistic interaction and endeavour between the artist, the audience and curator.
        <br>Her contemporary art practice encompasses photography, film, drawing, sculpture, and installation. In her work, memories in relation to nature, place and the archive have played a primary role. 
        <br>She uses objects that act as memory totems to form topographies through various mediums. Constructing landscapes is in essence reforming their original location from fading memories. The work merges the self with the earth and is both an exploration of personal identity, homeland and the power of place. Composing the landscapes by hand is a means of metaphysically wandering through the terrain. 
        <br>She also examines the human desire for immortality, often through objects or photographs within the archive context. Her works are a method of exploring a sense of place and understanding of self in the universe.
