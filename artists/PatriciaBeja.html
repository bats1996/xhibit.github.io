    <h2>Patricia Beja</h2>
    <h3>BA (Hons) Illustration and Visual Media<br>London College of Communication</h3>
    <p>I am a visual communicator particularly attracted to 2D animation and I like to research topics that interest me, such as climate issues, music and cultures/subcultures.My creative adventure started during A-Levels when I studied Visual Arts in Lisbon, Portugal, which taught me various disciplines, such as painting, printmaking, and design. This newfound passion for art encouraged me to pursue a BA in Illustration and Visual Media at UAL. Through this degree,I discovered the world of animation. My obsession with colour became a distinct aesthetic in my work that helps me produce different sensations on the human eye.Sounds Like London is a social and cultural documentary of a subculture: grime. Twenty years ago, from the bowels of Bow, East London, an intriguing movement was born. The voice of a generation that needed to be heard was boiling ﬁercely under the ﬂame of London’s most powerful ﬁnancial district, Canary Wharf. That voice was loud and unapologetic towards society, and provocative for those who cared enough to dive into the verses. Grime was that voice. A genre of electronic dance music that emerged in London at the turn of the twenty-ﬁrst century, became the voice of the British youth, and ended up taking over the UK.</p>
